LaunchDarkly Event Source SDK for .NET
===========================

Project Information
-----------

The LaunchDarkly EventSource SDK is a .NET library that allows developers to consume Server Sent Events from a remote API. The server sent events spec is defined here: [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html](http://example.com)

This library supports .NET 4.5+ and .NET Standard 1.6+.

Quick setup
-----------

**Nuget Restore**
1. If you have nuget package restore automatically enabled, Visual Studio will attempt to restore the nuget packages upon opening the LaunchDarkly.EventSource.sln
2. Otherwise, after you open LaunchDarkly.EventSource.sln, Right+Click on the solution and select "Restore NuGet Packages"

**Build Solution**
1. In Visual Studio, Build the LaunchDarkly.EventSource.sln solution

**Running the example Console App**

Included in the solution is a Console App that shows example usage for using the LaunchDarkly EventSource library.

NOTE: You'll need your LaunchDarkly API Key before running the Console app.

1. Compile and Run the EventSource-ConsoleApp project. 
   1. Select the EventSource-ConsoleApp project in the Solution Explorer.
   2. Open the Program.cs file.
   3. Replace "Insert Auth Key" with your LaunchDarkly API key.
   4. Go to the Debug menu and select Start Debugging (or hit the F5 key).

Testing
-------

We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all behave correctly.

**Running Unit Tests Locally**

The included LaunchDarkly.EventSource.Tests project contains units tests which use XUnit. To run the unit tests:
1. In Visual Studio, go to the Test Menu and select Run -> All Tests (or Ctrl+R, A).

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
