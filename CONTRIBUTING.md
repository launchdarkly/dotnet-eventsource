# Contributing to the LaunchDarkly EventSource SSE Client

LaunchDarkly has published an [SDK contributor's guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/sdk-contributors-guide) that provides a detailed explanation of how our SDKs work. See below for additional information on how to contribute to this SDK.

## Submitting bug reports and feature requests

The LaunchDarkly SDK team monitors the [issue tracker](https://github.com/launchdarkly/dotnet-eventsource/issues) in this repository. Bug reports and feature requests specific to this package should be filed in this issue tracker. The SDK team will respond to all newly filed issues within two business days.
 
## Submitting pull requests
 
We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Before submitting pull requests, ensure that all temporary or unintended code is removed. Don't worry about adding reviewers to the pull request; the LaunchDarkly SDK team will add themselves. The SDK team will acknowledge all pull requests within two business days.
 
## Build instructions
 
### Prerequisites

This project has multiple target frameworks as described in [`README.md`](./README.md). The .NET Framework target can be built only in a Windows environment; the others can be built either with or without a Windows environment. Download and install the latest .NET SDK tools first.

### Building
 
To install all required packages:

```
dotnet restore
```

To build all targets of the project without running any tests:

```
dotnet build src/LaunchDarkly.EventSource
```

Or, to build only the .NET Standard 2.0 target:

```
dotnet build src/LaunchDarkly.EventSource -f netstandard2.0
```
 
### Testing
 
To run all unit tests, for all targets:

```
dotnet test test/LaunchDarkly.EventSource.Tests
```

Or, to run tests only for the .NET Standard 2.0 target (using the .NET Core 2.1 runtime):

```
dotnet test test/LaunchDarkly.EventSource.Tests -f netcoreapp2.1
```

Note that the unit tests can only be run in Debug configuration. There is an `InternalsVisibleTo` directive that allows the test code to access internal members of the library, and assembly strong-naming in the Release configuration interferes with this.
